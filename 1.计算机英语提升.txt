one of the computerlike devices was developed in Germany by Konrad Zuse in 1941.
第一个类似计算机的装置之一是1941年由德国的Konrad Zuse研制的，
called the z3,it was general-purpose,stored-program machine with many electronic parts,but it had a mechanical memory.
叫做Z3,它是通用型储存程序机器，具有许多电子部件，但是它的存储器是机械的。
another electromechanical com-puting machine was developed by howard aiken,with financial assistance from ibm,at harvard university in 1943.
另一台机电式计算机器是由霍华德.艾坎在IBM的资助下于1943年在哈佛大学研制的。
it was called the automatic sequence control calculator mark i ,or simply the harvard mark i .
它被称为自动序列控制计算器Mark I,或简称哈佛Mark I。
neither of these machines was a true computer ,however,because they were not entirely electronic.
然而，这些机器都不是真正的计算机,因为它们不是完全电子化的。

perhaps the most influential of the early computerlike devices was the electronic numerical integrator and computer,or ENIAC.
也许早期最具影响力的类似计算机的装置应该是电子数字积分计算机，或简称ENIAC。
it was developed by j.presper eckert and john mauchly  at the university of pennsylvania.
它是由宾夕凡尼亚大学的J. Presper Eckert 和John Mauchly 研制的。
the project began in 1943 and was completed in 1946.
该工程于1943年开始，并于1946年完成。
the machine was huge .it weighed 30 tons and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes.

这台机器极其庞大，重达30吨，而且包含18,000多个真空管。

the ENIAC was a major advancement for its time.
ENIAC是当时重要的成就。
it was the first general-purpose, electronic computing machine and was capable of performing thousands of operations per second.
它是第一台通用型电子计算机器，并能够执行每秒数千次运算。
it was controlled, however ,by switches and plugs that had to be manually set.
然而,它是由开关和继电器控制的，必须手工设定。
thus,although it was a  general-purpose electronic device,it did not have a stored program.
因此，虽然它是一个通用型电子装置，但是它没有储存程序。
therefore, it  did not have all the characteristics of a computer.
因此,它不具备计算机的所有特征。

while working o the ENIAC, eckert and mauchly were joined by a brilliant mathe-matician,john von neuman.
在ENIAC的研制中，一个天才的数学家Von Neuman(冯.诺伊曼)加入到  Eckert和Mauchly团队,
together,they developed the idea of a stored program computer .
他们一起提出了储存程序计算机的主意。
this machine,called the electronic discrete variable automatic computer, or EDVAC, was the first machine whose design included all the characteristics of a computer .
这部机器被称做电子离散变量自动计算机, 或简称EDVAC,是第一部包括了计算机所有特征的机器。
it  was not completed ,however ,until 1951.
然而,直到1951年，它一直没有完成。

before the EDVAC  was finished,several other machines were built that incorporated elements of the EDVAC design of eckert ,mauchly ,and von neuman.
在EDVAC完成之前，其他一些机器建成了，它们吸收了Eckert、Mauchly和Neuman设计的要素。
one was the electronic delay storage automatic computer, or EDSAC ,which was developed in cambridge,england .
其中一部是在英国剑桥研制的电子延迟存储自动计算机,或简称EDSAC，
it first operated in may of 1949 and is probably the world's first electronic stored-program,general-purpose computer to become operational.
它在1949年5月首次运行，它可能是世界的第一台电子储存程序、通用型计算机投入运行。
the first computer to operate in the united states was the  binary automatic computer,or BINAC,which became operational in august of 1949.
在美国运行的第一部计算机是二进制自动计算机,或简称BINAC,它在1949年8月投入运行。



第六章 【2014-9-19】每天进步一点点 

like other computing pioneers before them, eckert and mauchly formed a company in 1947 to develop  a  commercial computer.
像他们之前的其他计算机先驱一样,Eckert和Mauchly在1947年组成了一家公司开发商业计算机。
the company was called the eckert-mauchly computer corporation.
公司名叫Eckert-Mauchly计算机公司。
their objective was to design and build the universal automatic computer or univac.
他们的目标是设计并建造通用自动计算机或UNIVAC。
because of difficulties of getting financial support ,they had to sell the company to remington rand in 1950.
因为难以获得财政支持，他们不得不在1950年把公司卖给了Remington Rand公司。
eckert and mauchly continued to work on the univac at remington rand and completed it in 1951.
Eckert 和Mauchly继续在Remington Rand公司从事UNIVAC的研制工作，并在1951年取得成功。
known as the univac i , this machine was the first commercially avaiable computer.
众所周知的UNIVAC I机器是世界上第一部商业化计算机。



第七章  【2014-9-22】每天进步一点点 

the first univac i was delivered to the census bureau and used for the 1950 census.
第一台UNIVAC I被交付人口普查局用于1950年的人口普查。
the second univac i was used to predict that dwight eisenhower would win the 1952 presidential election,less than an hour after the polls closed.
在投票点关闭后1小时之内，第二台UNIVAC I 被用于预测D.艾森豪威尔会赢得1952年总统大选。
the univac i began the modern of computer use .
UNIVAC I开始了现代计算机的应用。

first-generation computers were cahracterized by the  use of vacuum tubes as their principal electronic component.
第一代计算机的特色是使用真空管为其主要电子器件。
vacuum tubes are bulky and produce a lot of heat ,so  first-generation computers were large and required extensive air conditioning to keep them cool.
真空管体积大且发热严重,因此第一代计算机体积庞大，并且需要大量的空调设备保持冷却。
in addition ,because vacuum tubes do not operate very fast,these computers were relatively slow .
此外, 因为真空管运行不是很快，这些计算机运行速度相对较慢。



第九章 【2014-9-24】每天进步一点点

the nuivac i was the first commercial computer in this generation .
UNIVAC I是第一代中最早的商业化计算机。
as noted earlier ,it was used in the census bureau in 1951.
如前所述，它在1951年被用于人口普查局。
it was  also the first computer to be  used  in a business application .
它还是第一部用于商业应用的计算机。
in 1954,general electric took delivery of a univac i and used it for some of its business data processing.
在1954年,通用电气接收了UNIVAC I,并用它进行一些商业数据处理。

第十章 【2014-9-25】每天进步一点点

the univac i was not the most popular first-generation computer, however this honor goes to the IBM 650.
然而,UNIVAC I并不是最流行的第一代计算机。这一荣誉属于IBM 650。
it  was first delivered in 1955 before remington rand could come out with  a  successor to  the univac i
它在Remington Rand能够造出UNIVAC I的后续产品之前的1955年首次交付使用。
with the ibm 650,ibm captured the  majority of the computer market , a position it  still holds today.
凭借IBM 650,IBM占有了大半计算机市场，它在今天仍然保持这一位置。
