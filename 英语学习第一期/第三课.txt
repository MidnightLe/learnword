the eniac was a major advancement for its time .
it was the first general-purpose electronic computing machine  and was 
capable of performing thousands of operations per second.
it was controlled ,however,by switches and plugs that had to be
manually set. thus ,although it was a general-purpose electronic device, it
did not have a stored program . therefore,it did not have all the characteristics of a computer.

ENIAC是当时的重大进步。
它是第一台通用电子计算机，
每秒可以执行数千次操作。
但是，它是由必须由开关和插头控制的。
手动设置。 因此，尽管它是通用电子设备，
没有存储的程序。 因此，它不具备计算机的所有特性。
